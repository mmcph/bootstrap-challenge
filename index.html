					<p id="midContent">To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour
						is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a
						typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his
						characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.
						The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of
						these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a
						consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for
						instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a
						cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining
						one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit
						unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.</p>
